# explorekb-75
an open source 75% layout keyboard project as a start to my exploration in my keyboard making journey.

## Changelog

<ul>

<li>
Rev 4

Due to conflict of space between Controller Board and plate, controller board is shifted, allowing for plate to cover full length of Keyboard PCB.

Keyboard PCB:
- Shifted Blackpill Controller Board to the edge of the keyboard PCB, cut-out Keyboard PCB to allow for Blackpill to solder directly onto keyboard PCB with the USB port be like a center-mount USB on the keyboard PCB.
- Rotated OLED display 180 degrees. (now facing down)

Plate:

- WIP

</li>

<li>
Rev 3 

Keyboard PCB:
- Reverted back to using development board as controller, specifically using WeAct Studio Blackpill STM32F401 Controller Board.
- Tweaked layout to have 15 keys on ROW 0, including last 2 columns, COL 13 and 14 to be EC11 rotary encoders.
- Changed to have all diodes be BAT54C.
- Added OLED screen. (facing up)

Plate: <br>
Due to conflict of space between Controller Board and plate, the plate is unable to cover full length of Keyboard PCB, 3d printing the plate is then the safer option.

- Due to the change in layout from Rev 2 to Rev 3, <b> Rev 2 plates are NOT compatible with Rev 3 Keyboard PCB</b>.
